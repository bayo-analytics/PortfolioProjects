# COVID Data Analysis (SQL & Tableau)

A SQL project analyzing two (2) years' worth of data of COVID infection. The dataset includes new cases, new deaths, infection rate, vaccination data and infected countries. It tracks the cases data, infection and death rates, and all the countries or continents infected to support detailed analysis.

## Project Overview

This project analyzes global COVID data to uncover trends in confirmed cases, deaths, and vaccinations across contries and over time. SQL was used for data cleaning, transformation, and analysis, while Tableau was used to build an interactive dashboard for visualization.

## Table of Contents

## Tools & Technologies

- SQL
- Tableau
- Excel/CSV

## Dataset

The dataset in use contains detailed information about COVID, sourced from "Our World in Data". It encompasses a diverse range of data points related to the cases, deaths, vaccination data, countries, and date information of COVID. The dataset covers the total cases, total deaths, death percentage, and percentage population infected across all countries. This dataset serves as an invaluable resource for individuals seeking to practice data analysis techniques.

## SQL Analysis

SQL was used to:
- Clean and prepare the dataset for analysis
- Calculate total cases, total deaths, death percentages, and percentage population infected
- Analyze infection rates by country relative to population
- Track vaccination progress
- Create views to support Tableau visualization

## Tableau Dashboard

The dashboard provides interactive insights into:
- Global COVID cases and deaths over time
- Continents with the highest death rates
- Countries with the highest infection rates
- Trends filtered by country and date

## Key Insights

- As of the analysis period, global COVID cases exceeded 150 million, with a global death percentage of approximately 2.1%.
- Europe recorded the highest total number of COVID deaths among all continents, while other continents had lower totals.
- Countries such as the United States and France showed high percentages of population infected compared to other countries.
- Infection rates increased steadily from early 2020, with sharp growth observed toward late 2020 and early 2021.
- Nigeria recorded a significantly lower percentage of population infected compared to countries in Europe and North America.

## Conclusion

This analysis highlights the key patterns of the COVID pandemic across countries and continents, including trends in cases, deaths and infection rates. It shows how the impact of the virus varied between regions and over time, providing a clear picture of global COVID dynamics and the differences in outcomes between countries. Thank you for viewing this project. I completed this project to showcase my data analysis skills using a data set from a real organization called "Our World in Data". I am actively seeking data analyst roles and I am open to new opportunities. If you are interested in discussing opportunities or have any feedback, I would love to hear from you.
